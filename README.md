# Financial Data Portfolio

## About
Hi, my name is Chris and I am an aspiring financial data analyst. I double majored in finance and business analytics at Boston College, developing a passion for solving problems through quantitative analysis. This repository will contain some of my independent investment/finance related projects to showcase my relevant skills.

When I began college, I only intended to major in finance, but I added a business analytics major after my sophomore year because I recognized the increasing prevalence and importance of data-driven decision making in the world. I was captivated by how organizations, specifically sports teams at first, were harnessing the potential of data to make informed decisions and unlock untapped opportunities. Adding that major has set me on a path to hopefully one day become a data analyst for a company dedicated to DDDM.

## Portfolio Projects

### Brown Foreman Stock Price Prediction Model
**Code**: [BF_stock_price_prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/csnow27/Financial-Data-Portfolio/blob/main/BF_stock_price_prediction.ipynb)

**Description**: Using Facebook's Prophet Model, a procedure for forecasting time series data, I created a program in Python that predicts the stock price for Brown-Forman ($BF-B) based on its last five years of trading data from Yahoo Finance. Steps to complete this analysis included loading the data from Yahoo Finance with pandas, cleaning and querying, exploratory data analysis, ensuring the Durbin Watson and Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests were passed, splitting the training and testing data, creating visualizations with MATPLOTLIB and evaluating model performance with forecast error terms.
